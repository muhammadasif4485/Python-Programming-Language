what is string?

In Python, a string is a data type used to store **textual information**. 
It is a sequence of characters such as letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces. 
Strings are enclosed in quotes (either single, double, or triple quotes) and are one of the most commonly used 
data types in Python programming.

Strings are used to represent words, sentences, messages, file names, and any other type of text data. 
Python treats each character in the string as a separate element, which means you can access, manipulate, 
and analyze individual characters or groups of characters within a string.

Because most programs define and gather some sort of data and then do something useful with it, 
it helps to classify different types of data. The first data type weâ€™ll look at is the string. 
Strings are quite simple at first glance, but you can use them in many different ways.
A string is a series of characters. Anything inside quotes is considered a string in Python, 
and you can use single or double quotes around your strings like this:

"This is a string."
'This is also a string.'
    ''')
