(1) what is varibale?
In Python, a variable is like a container that holds data or a value. 
You can think of it as a name that refers to something stored in the computer's memory.

x = 10
name = "Muhammad Asif"
is_active = True

x is a variable that holds the number 10
name holds the string "Muhammad Asif"
is_active holds the Boolean value True
""")


print("""
(2) Rules for Naming Variables:
Must start with a letter or an underscore (_)

Cannot start with a number

Can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores

Case-sensitive (name and Name are different)

Avoid using Python keywords as variable names (like if, class, for, etc.)

Examples of valid variable names:

age = 25
_first_name = "Ali"
user_123 = "John"
""")
